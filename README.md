CEN302 Software Engineering course project. 

Businessmen in Albania are concerned that their businesses are not getting the right attention from their customers. They also do not have a platform with which they can reach a high number of customers while providing discounts for them. This is where Rhino, the superhero of discounts comes in help. Rhino is a mobile application which provides instant access to latest discounts. Every business can showcase their discounts and every user can take advantage of those discounts:
•	Discounts in categories in which customers are interested
•	Latest discounts of every business in your area
•	Increase your revenues by increasing your number of customers
•	Gather insight of your sales progress

The purpose of this project is to use technology in order to improve customer experience and facilitate business sales. The market of Albania is still suffering and customers have so little information regarding the possibilities they have to save more money. This software will provide a very organized, hybrid and comprehensive solution for these issues.
